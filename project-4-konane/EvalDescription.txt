The static eval uses the difference between the symbols for the current player and the opponent to assign a
value to the board. It further substracts the number of legal moves for the opponent from it.
This would return 0 if the number of symbols are the same for both and no possible values for the opponents.
This is the optimal condition for the player to win. Any negative value is desirable for the player 
and undesirable for the opponent.
