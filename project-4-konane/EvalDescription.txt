The static eval uses the difference between the number of legal moves for the current player and the opponent to assign a
value to the board. 
Thus, it would return 0 if the number of moves are the same for both.
It assigns a value of 100 to the board if there are no possible moves for the opponent. This is the optimal condition for the player to win. 
It would return -100 if there are no possible moves for the current player.
Any negative value is undesirable for the player and desirable for the opponent.
