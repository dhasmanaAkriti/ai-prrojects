Project 1 : Eliza is a chatbot that can talk to human users and play games with them.

It can recognize when the user is not that engaged in conversation and tell the user 
riddles and jokes
(that it does not repeat) from its endless (not literally) repository.

It can also play tictactoe with the user or imitate them.
To exit conversations with Eliza, 
user can type in bye, goodbye or a host of different exit commands.
Eliza also boasts of a 
memory with a record of previous responses given to her by the user.
This chatbot was built using Python 3.8.1.


Project 2 : This program solves the missionaries and cannibals problem by employing the state space search. 
The improved search refines the search method so that no node is visited again. This helps make sure that no 
state is repeated when we try to find the solution to the riddle. The solution ws found using Python 3.8.1.
